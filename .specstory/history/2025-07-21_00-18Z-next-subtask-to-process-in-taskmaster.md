_**Assistant**_

I'll help you find the next subtask to work on using Taskmaster. Let me check your current task status and identify what's next.


---



---

The next subtask to work on is **10.2: Subscription Tier Management and Feature Access Control**. This is a high-priority subtask that depends on subtask 10.1 being completed.

Let me get more details about this subtask and its parent task to give you the full context:


---



---

Now let me get the specific details for subtask 10.2:


---



---

Perfect! The next subtask to work on is **10.2: Subscription Tier Management and Feature Access Control**.

## Summary of the Next Subtask:

**Task ID:** 10.2  
**Title:** Subscription Tier Management and Feature Access Control  
**Status:** Pending  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** 10.1 (âœ… Completed)

### What needs to be implemented:

1. **Create methods to detect user's active subscriptions**
2. **Implement tier-based feature access control system**
3. **Add hooks for subscription status changes** (`woocommerce_subscription_status_updated`)
4. **Create subscription product mapping to features in admin settings**
5. **Implement caching for subscription status checks**
6. **Create helper methods** like `can_access_feature($feature_name)` for easy integration
7. **Add unit tests for feature access control logic**

### Context:
This subtask is part of the larger **WooCommerce Integration** task (Task 10), which is currently in-progress. The parent task focuses on integrating with WooCommerce subscriptions to control feature access based on subscription tiers. Subtask 10.1 (WooCommerce Subscription Detection and Activation) has already been completed, so you can now build upon that foundation.

The implementation should include:
- Subscription tier detection logic
- Feature access control based on user subscription status
- Admin settings for configuring product-to-tier mappings
- Caching mechanisms for performance
- Helper methods for easy integration throughout the plugin

Would you like me to help you start implementing this subtask or would you like to see more details about any specific aspect of the implementation?

I see subtask 9.2 is pedning

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! Let me check the current task status to see what's actually available to work on.


---



---

You're absolutely correct! Looking at the pending tasks, I can see that **subtask 9.2** is indeed pending and available to work on. Let me get the details for subtask 9.2:


---



---

Perfect! You're absolutely right. The next subtask to work on is **9.2: Implement Repost Pattern Display Interface**.

## Summary of the Next Subtask:

**Task ID:** 9.2  
**Title:** Implement Repost Pattern Display Interface  
**Status:** Pending  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** 9.1 (âœ… Completed)

### What needs to be implemented:

1. **Create a tabbed interface** for different data views (patterns, trends, content suggestions)
2. **Implement data tables** to display repost pattern information with sortable columns
3. **Add AJAX functionality** to load pattern data dynamically using `wp_ajax` hooks
4. **Create visual representations** (charts/graphs) using a library like Chart.js
5. **Implement filters** for time periods, content types, and performance metrics
6. **Add tooltips and help text** to explain metrics and data points
7. **Ensure all tables and charts are responsive** for different screen sizes

### Context:
This subtask is part of the **User Dashboard UI** task (Task 9), which focuses on creating a WordPress admin/front-end UI for displaying repost patterns and AI-generated content to users. Subtask 9.1 (Create User Dashboard UI Framework) has already been completed, so you can build upon that foundation.

The implementation should create an interactive, user-friendly interface that allows users to:
- View repost patterns in an organized, tabbed layout
- Sort and filter data dynamically
- See visual representations of trends and analytics
- Access helpful tooltips and explanations
- Use the interface on various screen sizes

This is a great next step since it builds on the completed dashboard framework and will provide users with the core functionality to view and interact with their repost pattern data.

Would you like me to help you start implementing this subtask or would you like to see more details about any specific aspect of the implementation?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you develop subtask 9.2: Implement Repost Pattern Display Interface. Let me start by exploring the current codebase to understand the existing dashboard structure and then implement the required components.


---



---

Now let me explore the existing dashboard structure to understand what's already in place:


---

Read file: xelite-repost-engine/includes/class-repost-intelligence-dashboard.php

---

Now let me check the existing patterns template to see what's already implemented:


---

Read file: xelite-repost-engine/templates/dashboard/patterns.php

---

Now let me check the existing CSS and JavaScript files to understand the current styling and functionality:


---

Read file: xelite-repost-engine/assets/css/dashboard.css

---

Now let me check the JavaScript file to understand the current functionality:


---

Read file: xelite-repost-engine/assets/js/dashboard.js

---

Now let me check if there are any existing pattern visualizer or analyzer classes to understand the data structure:


---

Read file: xelite-repost-engine/includes/class-xelite-repost-engine-pattern-visualizer.php

---

Now let me update the subtask with my findings and start implementing the enhanced pattern display interface:


---



---

Now let me start implementing the enhanced pattern display interface. First, I'll enhance the dashboard class to add the necessary AJAX handlers for dynamic data loading:


---



---

Now let me add the enhanced AJAX handlers at the end of the class:


---



---

Now let me enhance the dashboard assets to include Chart.js and improve the JavaScript functionality:


---



---

Now let me enhance the patterns template to include Chart.js visualizations and improved filtering:


---



---

Now let me add Chart.js visualizations to the patterns template:


---



---

Now let me enhance the CSS to support the new features:
